				<p>Welcome to the Poker Game Tracker.  This site keeps track of the games played and the players point standing after playing in the poker games.  There are three main features to this site listed below</p>
				<br>
				<p>Game Manager</p>
				<p>This will let you add new games to the list as well add players to the list of players to choose from.  You will be presented with a form to fill of the details of the upcoming game and who will be playing in the game.  Once done, submit the form.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Game List</p>
				<p>This will be a list of all the games played previously as well as upcoming games.  If the current time is past the time a game has been played, it will give the option to open a new page to choose who the winners of that current game was.  This will update the scores of those players</p>
				<br>
				<p>Player Standings</p>
				<p>A full list of all the players and their current score on the leaderboard.  This is calculated based on the players to take the first 3 places in a game.  1st place gets as many points equal to the number of players.  2nd gets the number of players divided by 2.  3rd place gets the number of players divided by 3</p>
				<br>
				<p>Why was this site created?</p>
				<p>We like to play poker games on a regular basis and occasionally we would have a player of the year where we kept track of who did well in games and assigned a point total.  This caused a headache for one poor soul who had to keep an excel sheet of all of the results.  This site should hopefully alleviate that headache as well as add some additional functionality</p>
